            Lazy Train operates by taking in user inputs, through a number of options available to the user, and using them to search a database of exercises that match those filters.
            For the purposes of this project, the database in use is handmade and does not fully explore the training world; there are a limited number of options just to demonstrate functionality.
            That being said, each of the options made available will be relevant to at least one exercise, meaning that all filters (when used alone) will return <span class="italics">at least one</span> exercise.

            Finally, there are a number of different equipment options available. Some of them are generalized for the sake of this assignment.
            For example, chest dips and pull ups are listed as requiring a "machine," where they really only need one or two bars; machine in these cases counts as any sort of "apparatus" the user might incorporate.
            Likewise, cables are included with machines and kettlebells are grouped with barbells or dumbbells (depending on the exercise).
